<p>My name is Lynnette Horner.</p>
<p>I am a writer, copy editor, wife, mother of four, and lifelong Christian. I spent most of my journey of faith as an Evangelical, and by 2009, after spending years looking for “something more,” I was burned out, weary, and disillusioned. I was fed up with the many expressions and conflicting teachings of Protestant Christian faith and felt I had nowhere to turn.</p>
<p>In 2012, along with my husband and two younger children, I was received into the Eastern Orthodox Christian Church. I was still weary and confused, and I’m still a work in progress, but I found renewed hope, the beauty of solid, unchanging theology, and a clear spiritual path for growing in Christ and becoming one with Him.</p>
<p>In this blog, I help weary, burned-out pilgrims explore the unchanging roots of the Christian faith in order to find hope, renewal, and community in Christ and His Church. I don’t have all the answers, but I know where to look. Together we will listen to the collective wisdom of the ancient Church fathers and mothers, figure out how to live out our faith in a modern, short-attention-span world, and walk through the rhythms of the ecclesiastical year. There is hope for the future. And that hope cannot be found in the next new thing, but in the wisdom of the past.</p>
<p>Let’s journey together.</p>
