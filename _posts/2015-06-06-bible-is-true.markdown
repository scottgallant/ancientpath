Along with a small group of college students, Rob and I have been reading through a book that has really challenged my thinking, written by Fr. Stephen Freeman, called Everywhere Present: Christianity in a One-Story Universe.  The basic message of the book is that Western thinking, both secular and Christian, has relegated God to a different sphere of life… [better explanation].

What really struck me is that I spent my life as a Protestant affirming the Bible as the Word of God yet completely ignored the logic of passages that affirm the communion of the saints, living and dead. All of us as one Church—not a congregation somewhere off in a heavenly realm and the rest of us mucking about on Earth.

The Trisagion prayers, which are a part of the morning and evening rhythms of the Orthodox prayer life, begin with “O Heavenly King, the Comforter, the Spirit of Truth, Who are everywhere present and fills all things. Treasury of blessings and Giver of Life, come and abide in us, and cleanse us from every impurity, and + save our souls, O Good One!”

God is everywhere present and fills all things, not in the pantheistic sense of everything being god, but in the sense that there is no place where He is not. As King David wrote so eloquently in Psalm 138/139, 
>Where can I go from Your Spirit?
Or where can I flee from Your presence?
If I ascend into heaven, You are there;
If I make my bed in hell, behold, You are there.
If I take the wings of the morning,
And dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,
Even there Your hand shall lead me,
And Your right hand shall hold me.

I can’t think of a single Protestant denomination that would argue against God’s everywhere-ness, otherwise known as Omnipresence.

But the Bible has a lot to say not only about God’s presence but about who is there with Him. 

In his letter to the Hebrews, Paul gives his famous roll call of faith in chapter 11, listing the many heroes of the [Old Testament]. He then concludes in chapter 12, “Therefore we also, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us….”

He is not talking about a bunch of dead people “up there.” He says we are surrounded by them—the saints. Yet I never heard this concept discussed in a sermon or Bible study; the interpretation tended to be along the lines of the saints as examples who have gone before us. No talk about being surrounded.

But if the saints are in God’s presence, and God is everywhere present, and Paul says we are surrounded by a cloud of witnesses, then logically it follows that…

Nope. Stop it. Can’t go there. That sounds way too Catholic.

So we keep the dead away up there, somewhere, all the while affirming that the Bible is true yet ignoring any scriptures that might point to something… Catholic-ish. 

As I was trying to understand the concept of asking for the intercession of the saints, I had great difficulty. I told a priest, “I know that the saints are alive in Christ and in His presence, but how do I know they can hear me if I talk to them?” He looked around the restaurant, lifted his hands, and said, “They’re here.”

But—but—how do you know that? I didn’t get it. And only recently have I reached a more holistic understanding of spiritual reality.

[Bible examples: Revelation and the saints’ active interest in the warfare going on in earth and heaven; Jesus talking to Moses and Elijah; Jesus mentioning dead guys then saying, “God is a God of the living, not the dead”; cloud of witnesses]
