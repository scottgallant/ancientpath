When I was growing up in a United Methodist Church that was quite evangelistic and with some charismatic elements (hard to imagine nowadays), I had some friends who were Episcopal. Occasionally I would hear references to their Book of Common Prayer, which I thought was odd. Why would anyone need a book to pray? Don’t they know how to talk to God?

I considered written prayers to be “canned”—somebody else’s script, about as spiritually nutritious as limp, tinned vegetables—not “real” prayers, prayed from the heart. I didn’t consider the fact that the entire book of Psalms consists of 150 canned prayers, and they are considered the prayer book of the Church. I also conveniently forgot that when Jesus told us how to pray, he gave us a scripted prayer—the Lord’s Prayer.

I’m sure it goes back to my upbringing and surroundings. Although I grew up in a Methodist church that had formal, liturgical services, including a congregational prayer in the service, the practice didn’t spread to youth group and certainly not to the many Protestant nondenominational churches we attended over the years.

But as I was introduced to different Orthodox prayer services and individual prayers for different occasions, I’ve had to get honest about past experiences with corporate prayer, my own prayer life, and the deep wisdom of these written prayers.

On a personal level, when I pray about a personal need, I tend to focus more on the need than on God. I rehash and explain the problem, as if He didn’t know all. Often I wind up feeling anger, hurt, and unforgiveness all over again then need to ask forgiveness for that and try to get back on track. Or if I’m praying for someone else, I tend to tell God what He should do—claiming a healing He has not necessarily promised or trampling over someone’s free will because I “know” what they “should” be doing. Don’t get me started on the subtle judgment and arrogance that can underlie such prayers.

My experience with corporate prayer has been problematic on a lot of different levels. I’ve seen and heard a lot of weird stuff: rampant misuse of scripture as people find a verse that fits the moment and use it as a sort of weapon to remind God that He’s supposed to do what He promises. (Never mind that the verse is often taken wildly out of context.) I have heard people make theological pronouncements in prayer that are not necessarily true. I have heard a whole lot of claiming (demanding?) of a whole lot of things. Sometimes these prayers have been offered with beautiful repentance, humility, and a sense of deep need, but often, not so much.

Sometimes I wonder if a lot of the praying I’ve been involved in is really an expression of faith. Perhaps it’s more a lack of faith. Sometimes there’s a sense of begging God over and over so that He’ll finally answer. I am well aware of Jesus’ words, “Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you” (Matt. 7:7). I’ve read that this verse is better translated, “Keep asking,” “keep seeking,” “keep knocking.” And I think about Jesus’ story of the persistent widow in Luke 18, who kept asking for justice from the judge, who finally relented because he was so weary of her.

And yet… I compare all this time, all these words, with a simple, humble prayer to God, leaving troubles with Him and trusting that He knows and cares. There is nothing showy or loud about such prayer, just a quiet confidence in God’s love and goodness.

I grapple with this. And I know that when genuine crisis arrives, I will keep asking, keep seeking, keep knocking.

And yet again… I come back to these written prayers. They do not exist because one person wrote a book and promoted her teaching videos. Orthodox prayers, compiled in book form, do not “sell” because of the publisher’s marketing campaign. True, the prayers are put together in various collections and sold. But they are also available online for free. These prayers are not copyrighted, and they are not part of some publisher’s bright-eyed marketing campaign. They they are passed around and disseminated from the grassroots, from lay people, priests, monks, and bishops who, guided by the Holy Spirit, agree together, in different eras and in different places, that “this is good stuff.” These prayers belong not to a famous speaker or publishing house; they belong to the Church.

Here is an example that is part of the Orthodox morning prayers, which are used in monasteries and incorporated by individuals as a part of their personal “prayer rule.” It is the prayer of the Optina Elders—monks at a hermitage about 80 miles from Moscow. I believe it is from the 19th century:

O Lord, grant me to greet the coming of the day in peace. Help me in all things to rely upon Your holy will. In every hour of the day reveal Your will to me. Bless my dealings with all who surround me. Teach me to treat all that comes to me throughout the day with peace of soul and with firm conviction that Your will governs all. In all my deeds and words, guide my thoughts and feelings. In unforeseen events, let me not forget that all are sent by You. Teach me to act firmly and wisely, without embittering and embarrassing others. Give me strength to bear the fatigue of the coming day with all that it shall bring. Direct my will, teach me to pray. And, Yourself, pray in me. Amen.

[This should be at start] Prayed on a daily basis in the morning, this is a prayer that will shape you. Several years ago I went through a period of difficult decision-making, and the words of this prayer sustained me in a way that my own made-up words never could. I truly experienced a peace of soul, a surrender to God’s will, and a desire “to act firmly and wisely” as a fruit of this prayer in my life. I was also keenly aware that my words and actions could definitely embitter and embarrass others. Shaped by these wise, Spirit-led words, I was much more careful about guarding my tongue than I would have been on my own.

This is good stuff.
