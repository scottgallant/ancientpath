In the Orthodox Church, we fast a lot—twice a week during the regular routine, and for longer periods during several fasting seasons. Now, that doesn’t mean that we starve for weeks at a time. A fast day means no meat, no dairy, no olive oil, and usually, but not always, no wine—a vegan diet. Fish is sometimes allowed; some fasting seasons are easier than others. Also, with a couple of exceptions throughout the year, every Wednesday and every Friday are fast days.

Why Wednesdays and Fridays? One of the earliest Christian manuscripts, the Didache, or Teaching of the Twelve Apostles (written somewhere between AD50–120), states: “Your fasts must not be identical with those of the hypocrites. They fast on Mondays and Thursdays; but you should fast on Wednesdays and Fridays” [D8:1-2]. The author was referring to Jewish fast days. Additionally, we fast on Wednesdays to remember Jesus’ betrayal by Judas Iscariot and on Fridays to remember Jesus’ crucifixion. That’s more than enough mindfulness for me to handle. The nationwide effort to get Americans to eat less meat, Meatless Mondays, makes me groan. I’m already doing my part, thank you.

Combine the two days a week with the 50-odd days of fasting during Lent and Holy Week, the Nativity Fast during the month before Christmas, The Apostles’ fast after Pentecost, and the two-week Dormition fast in August, and observant Orthodox folks are fasting for about a third of the calendar year.

It all sounds a bit legalistic, doesn’t it? It can be, just as any discipline can become an empty rule if we neglect the heart behind it. But there are aspects of prescribed fasting days that are quite healing and spiritually beneficial. Here are a few of them:

### It’s not about me.

When I was a Protestant, fasting was an individualistic activity. I did it when I “felt” the need, whether seeking direction from God or answers in prayer. I might fast with a buddy for a particular purpose, with a group (say, the missions committee or prayer ministry), or just on my own. And the rules of fasting varied according to personal preference—strict water fast, strict liquids-only fast, skipping a meal a day, giving up chocolate, etc. At the end of the day, it was all about my choice—my selection from the religious smorgasbord of options for spiritual growth. Just me and Jesus, doing our thing.

In contrast to this individualized approach, corporate fasting—fasting not as an individual, not as a group, not even as a local community of believers, but as a part of the worldwide Body of Christ—is about us. It has nothing to do with my feelings or the Spirit speaking specifically to me (and, by extension, not to you). It is about the need we all have to curb the desires of the flesh, to gain discipline, and to seek God together. It’s not something that needs to be talked about—“Should we fast about this?”—except to accommodate fasting seasons during Church potlucks and coffee hours. In fact, talking about it is discouraged. [“Put on your party clothes, etc.] You fast or you don’t fast, but you’d better not brag about it. And don’t be nosy, either. Your non-fasting brother or sister may have health or dietary issues, and it’s not your business to judge.

### It’s not about suffering or giving up my personal favorite things.

In the Orthodox Church, nobody asks, “What are you giving up for Lent?” On the [Q&A section of the website of the Orthodox Church in America](http://oca.org/questions), Fr. John Matusiak explains fasting well:  “The purpose of fasting is not to ‘give up’ things, nor to do something ‘sacrificial.’ …We fast in order to gain control, to discipline ourselves, to gain control of those things that we have allowed to get out of control.” 

>In our individualistic Western traditions, it’s normal to think, “I love chocolate, therefore I’m giving up candy. I drink too much caffeine, so I’m giving up coffee for Lent.” It may be personally beneficial to give up these things—just please don’t come between me and my coffee—but the individualistic aspect of this approach to fasting is foreign to the Church through the ages. Fr. Matusiak continues, “Giving up candy—unless one is controlled by candy—is not fasting. …We do not fast in order to suffer. We fast in order to get a grip on our lives and to regain control of those things that have gotten out of control. Further, as we sing during the first week of Great Lent, ‘while fasting from food, let us also fast from our passions.’” This leads to the third point.

### Fasting from food is only part of the picture.

There is a great, oft-repeated saying: “Fasting without prayer and almsgiving is dieting.” I’m not sure who said this first, but it bears repeating. If I merely abstain from certain foods without also devoting extra time to prayer (hopefully taken from the time required to plan and prepare fancy meals) and without giving extra money (money that I’ve saved by not buying expensive meats and cheeses), I’m simply going through the motions.

St. John Chrysostom, the great fourth-century preacher and the author of the Divine Liturgy used to this day, said it best:

> Do you fast? Give me proof of it by your works.
> If you see a poor man, take pity on him.
> If you see a friend being honored, do not envy him.
> Do not let only your mouth fast, but also the eye and the ear and the feet and the hands and all the members of our bodies.
> Let the hands fast, by being free of avarice.
> Let the feet fast, by ceasing to run after sin.
> Let the eyes fast, by disciplining them not to glare at that which is sinful.
> Let the ear fast, by not listening to evil talk and gossip.
> Let the mouth fast from foul words and unjust criticism.
> For what good is it if we abstain from birds and fishes, but bite and devour our brothers and sisters?
> May He who came to the world to save sinners strengthen us to complete the fast with humility, have mercy on us and save us.
> St. John Chrysostom

### Corporate fasting combats my spiritual pride.
I’m not doing this on my own to seek God with extra fervor. I’m doing it as a part of a Eucharistic community, walking together on our journey of salvation, committed to praying for and forgiving one another. When I fasted on my own, no matter how serious I was about my individual fasting commitment, no matter how much I kept it a secret, spiritual pride and satisfaction always crept in. “Well, if my other Christian friends tried fasting more often, they might conquer those besetting sins of theirs.”  (Okay, maybe you don’t have these kinds of thoughts. But maybe you’re better than me. Just don’t get too proud about that.) In fact, the ancient path of corporate fasting discourages any “extra-credit” individual initiative on this part of the spiritual journey. Extra spiritual disciplines should take place only under the direction of a spiritual father. The purpose of this is not “control” of the individual believer but “protection from” spiritual dangers.

A great example of this comes from Fr. Evan Armatas. In his excellent call-in podcast, “Orthodoxy Live” ([available HERE on Ancient Faith Radio](http://www.ancientfaith.com/podcasts/orthodoxylive)), Fr. Evan relates a story from his seminary days. He was talking with his spiritual father and mentioned that he had decided to do some extra things during Lent beyond the usual disciplines of prayer, fasting, almsgiving, and more frequent services. His priest—a man who actually knew him, not a stranger—asked where these ideas came from. Fr. Evan responded that he had just decided this on his own. His priest was rather unimpressed and gave him an assignment: He was to stop all fasting during Lent. Not only that, he was to eat meat in front of his fellow seminarians throughout the course of the Lenten fast without telling them why. As Fr. Evan related the story years later, that spiritual medicine was exactly what he needed. The awkwardness and embarrassment of eating non-fasting foods publicly took an ax to the root of his pride, his idea that he should “do his own thing.”
